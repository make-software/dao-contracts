<h2 id="definitions"><a href="#definitions">Definitions</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Job Offer - A description of a Job posted by JobPoster</li>
<li>Bid - on offer that can be accepted by the Job Poster</li>
<li>JobPoster - user of the system that posts a Job Offer; it has to be KYC’d</li>
<li>Worker - the user who does a job</li>
<li>Internal Worker - a Worker who completed the KYC and was voted to be a VotingAssociate</li>
<li>External Worker - a Worker who completed the KYC and is not a Voting Associate</li>
<li>Voting Associate (or VA) - users of the system with Reputation and permissions to vote</li>
<li>KYC - Know Your Customer, a process that validates that the user can be the user of the system</li>
<li>Bid Escrow Voting - Mints reputation</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="posting"><a href="#posting">Posting</a></h2>
<p>The first step of the <code>Bid Escrow</code> process is <code>Posting</code> a <a href="job_offer/struct.JobOffer.html"><code>Job Offer</code></a>.
It is done by <code>JobPoster</code> by sending a query to a <code>BidEscrow</code> contract containing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Expected timeframe for completing a <code>Job</code></li>
<li>Maximum budget for a <code>Job</code>
With the query, the <code>JobPoster</code> sends a <code>DOS fee</code> in <code>CSPR</code>. The minimum amount of a <code>DOS fee</code> is defined in
<a href="../variable_repository/trait.VariableRepositoryContractInterface.html"><code>Variable Repository Contract</code></a> under the key<code>PostJobDOSFee</code>.
This action creates a new object in the contract called <code>Job Offer</code> and starts the <code>Bidding process</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="bidding"><a href="#bidding">Bidding</a></h2>
<p>The <code>Bidding</code> process allows <code>Workers</code> to post <a href="bid/struct.Bid.html"><code>Bids</code></a> with the offer of completing a job.
It is divided into two main parts.</p>
<h4 id="internal-auction"><a href="#internal-auction">Internal Auction</a></h4>
<p>During this part of the Bidding process only the <code>VAs</code> can bid. As the <code>VAs</code> have <code>Reputation</code>, they are bidding using 
<a href="../reputation/trait.ReputationContractInterface.html"><code>Reputation</code></a> as a stake. The <code>Bid</code> query to the contract consists of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Proposed timeframe for completing the <code>Job</code>.</li>
<li>Proposed payment for the <code>Job</code>.</li>
<li>The amount of <code>Reputation</code> the <code>Internal Worker</code> stakes on this <code>Job</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Bid is then added to a list of available bids in the contract storage and is available for picking by the <code>Job Poster</code>.
The time of an <code>Internal Auction</code> is defined in a <a href="../variable_repository/index.html#available-keys"><code>Governance Variable</code></a> <code>InternalAuctionTime</code>. 
The bidding process can already be completed here, if the <code>JobPoster</code> decides to chose one of the posted Bids before <code>Internal Auction</code> ends. 
However, if no <code>Bid</code> is picked during this time, the process becomes a <code>Public Auction</code>.</p>
<h4 id="public-auction"><a href="#public-auction">Public Auction</a></h4>
<p>If no <code>Internal Worker</code> decides to post a <code>Bid</code> on a <code>Job Offer</code>, or the <code>Job Poster</code> did not pick any bid during <code>Internal Auction</code>, 
the <code>External Workers</code> have a chance of submitting their bids during <code>Public Auction</code> time. As <code>External Workers</code> do not have any 
<code>Reputation</code> to stake, they are staking <code>CSPR</code>.</p>
<p>A query to the contract in case of <code>External Workers</code> consists of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Proposed timeframe for completing the <code>Job</code>.</li>
<li>Proposed payment for the <code>Job</code>.</li>
<li>Decision if the <code>Worker</code> wants to become a <code>Voting Associate</code> if the <code>Job</code> is completed.</li>
<li><code>CSPR</code> stake sent alongside the query
<code>Internal Workers</code> by default cannot to submit their bids during <code>Public Auction</code>, however this behavior is configurable using 
<code>VACanBidOnPublicAuction</code> <a href="../variable_repository/index.html#available-keys"><code>Governance Variable</code></a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The time of a <code>Public Auction</code> is defined in a <a href="../variable_repository/index.html#available-keys"><code>Governance Variable</code></a> <code>PublicAuctionTime</code>.</p>
<h2 id="picking-a-bid"><a href="#picking-a-bid">Picking a Bid</a></h2>
<p>During the <code>Auction</code> process the <code>Job Poster</code> can pick a <code>Bid</code>.
When no <code>Bid</code> is posted or selected by <code>Job Poster</code> during both auctions, the <code>Job</code> is cancelled,
<code>DOS Fee</code> is returned to the <code>Job Poster</code> and stakes sent by the <code>Bidders</code> are returned to them.</p>
<h2 id="submitting-a-job-proof"><a href="#submitting-a-job-proof">Submitting a Job Proof</a></h2>
<p>Now the <code>Worker</code> has the time to complete the <code>Job</code> and submit its proof to the contract.
After the works have been completed, the <code>Worker</code> sends a query to the contract containing
the cryptographic hash of a document being a proof of <code>Work</code> done for a <code>Job Poster</code>.</p>
<p>When no <code>Bid</code> is posted or selected by the <code>Job Poster</code> during both auctions, the <code>Job</code> is cancelled, 
<code>DOS Fee</code> is returned to the <code>Job Poster</code> and stakes sent by the <code>Bidders</code> are returned to them.</p>
<h2 id="voting"><a href="#voting">Voting</a></h2>
<p>The Voting process is managed by <a href="../voting/struct.VotingEngine.html"><code>VotingEngine</code></a>.</p>
<h2 id="voting-passed"><a href="#voting-passed">Voting passed</a></h2>
<p>Besides yielding a positive result, the <code>Voting</code> passed means that the <code>Reputation</code> staked by the losing side is
redistributed between the winning side, depending on the type of <code>Worker</code>.</p>
<h4 id="external-worker-who-wanted-to-become-va"><a href="#external-worker-who-wanted-to-become-va">External Worker who wanted to become VA</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>The <code>External Worker</code> becomes VA.</li>
<li>The <code>CSPR</code> that were sent by the <code>External Worker</code> as a stake is returned to the <code>External Worker</code>.</li>
<li>Reputation of the voters who voted <code>yes</code> is returned to them.</li>
<li>Reputation of the voters who voted <code>no</code> is redistributed between the voters who voted <code>yes</code> proportional to the amount of 
reputation staked in the voting.</li>
<li>Reputation minted for the <code>External Worker</code> and used in the voting process is burned.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="internal-worker"><a href="#internal-worker">Internal Worker</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Reputation of the voters who voted <code>yes</code> is returned to them.</li>
<li>Reputation of the voters who voted <code>no</code> is redistributed between the voters who voted <code>yes</code> proportional to the amount of 
reputation staked in the voting.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="external-worker"><a href="#external-worker">External Worker</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>The <code>CSPR</code> that were sent by the <code>External Worker</code> as a stake is returned to the <code>External Worker</code>.</li>
<li>Reputation minted for the <code>External Worker</code> and used in the voting process is burned.</li>
<li>Reputation of the voters who voted <code>yes</code> is returned to them, except for the Reputation minted for the Worker using <code>CSPR</code> stake.</li>
<li>Reputation of the voters who voted <code>no</code> is redistributed between the voters who voted <code>yes</code> proportional to the amount of 
reputation staked in the voting (External Worker does not receive Reputation in this step).</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="payment-cspr-redistribution"><a href="#payment-cspr-redistribution">Payment CSPR Redistribution</a></h4>
<p>Reputation used for the Voting and minted after a successful <code>Job</code> has been redistributed during the above process, 
but there is <code>CSPR</code> to redistribute that was allocated to the <code>Job</code>. How much resources is redistributed and to whom 
depends on the type of <code>Worker</code> and whether it wanted to become a <code>VA</code>.</p>
<h4 id="payment-pool"><a href="#payment-pool">Payment pool</a></h4>
<p>The <code>CSPR</code> to redistribute is calculated using a formula:
<code>payment pool = job price</code></p>
<h4 id="external-worker-who-wants-to-become-va"><a href="#external-worker-who-wants-to-become-va">External Worker who wants to become VA</a></h4>
<p>As the External Worker now is the VA, it is considered to be an <code>Internal Worker</code> in this scenario.</p>
<h4 id="internal-worker-1"><a href="#internal-worker-1">Internal Worker</a></h4>
<p>Firstly the Governance Payment is calculated using a formula:</p>
<p><code>governance payment = payment pool * BidEscrowPaymentRatio</code> <a href="../variable_repository/index.html#available-keys">Read more</a>. </p>
<p>The <code>Governance Payment</code> is then transferred to a multisig wallet, which address is held in the <a href="../variable_repository/trait.VariableRepositoryContractInterface.html"><code>Variable Repository Contract</code></a> 
called <a href="../variable_repository/index.html#available-keys"><code>BidEscrowWalletAddress</code></a>.
The rest of the payment is redistributed between all of the <code>VAs'</code>.</p>
<p><code>remaining amount = payment pool - governance payment</code></p>
<h4 id="external-worker-1"><a href="#external-worker-1">External Worker</a></h4>
<p>If the <code>Job</code> was done by an <code>External Worker</code> who didn’t want to become a <code>VA</code>, the first step is the same
as in the case of <code>Internal Worker</code> - Governance Payment is being made. However the rest is then divided between 
the <code>External Worker</code> and the <code>VAs’</code>.</p>
<p>Firstly to get the amount that VA’s receive we use a formula:</p>
<p><code>VA payment amount = remaining amount * DefaultPolicingRate</code> <a href="../variable_repository/index.html#available-keys">Read more</a></p>
<p>Then, the rest is transferred to the <code>External Worker</code>:</p>
<p><code>External Worker payment amount = payment pool- governance payment - VA payment amount</code></p>
<h2 id="voting-failed"><a href="#voting-failed">Voting failed</a></h2>
<p>Besides yielding a negative result, the Voting passed means that the Reputation staked by the losing side is
redistributed between the winning side, depending on the type of Worker.</p>
<h4 id="external-worker-who-wanted-to-become-va-1"><a href="#external-worker-who-wanted-to-become-va-1">External Worker who wanted to become VA</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>The External Worked DOES NOT become a VA.</li>
<li>The <code>CSPR</code> that were sent by the <code>External Worker</code> as a stake is redistributed between the <code>VA</code>’s.</li>
<li>The Reputation minted for the <code>External Worker</code> using <code>CSPR</code> stake is burned.</li>
<li>Reputation of the voters who voted <code>no</code> is returned to them.</li>
<li>Reputation of the voters who voted <code>yes</code> is redistributed between the voters who voted <code>no</code> proportional to the amount of 
reputation staked in the voting.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="internal-worker-2"><a href="#internal-worker-2">Internal Worker</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Reputation of the voters who voted <code>no</code> is returned to them.</li>
<li>Reputation of the voters who voted <code>yes</code> is redistributed between the voters who voted <code>no</code> proportional to the amount of 
reputation staked in the voting.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="external-worker-2"><a href="#external-worker-2">External Worker</a></h4>
<p>The <code>CSPR</code> that were sent by the <code>External Worker</code> as a stake is redistributed between the <code>VA</code>’s.
The Reputation minted for the <code>External Worker</code> using <code>CSPR</code> stake is burned.
Reputation of the voters who voted <code>no</code> is returned to them.
Reputation of the voters who voted <code>yes</code> is redistributed between the voters who voted <code>no</code> proportional to the amount of 
reputation staked in the voting.</p>
<h4 id="cspr"><a href="#cspr">CSPR</a></h4>
<p>If the <code>Voting</code> fails, the <code>CSPR</code> sent to the contract as a payment for <code>Job</code> is returned to the <code>Job Poster</code>. If the work
has been attempted to do by an <code>External Worker</code> the <code>CSPR</code> that the <code>Worker</code> staked during the <code>Bid</code> process
is redistributed between all <code>VA</code>’s.</p>
<h2 id="quorum-not-reached"><a href="#quorum-not-reached">Quorum not reached</a></h2>
<p>When the <code>Quorum</code> is not reached during the <code>Formal Voting</code>, following things happen:</p>
<ul>
<li>The process ends here.</li>
<li><code>VA’s</code> stakes are returned to them.</li>
<li><code>Job</code> Poster payment and `DOS fee is returned.</li>
<li><code>Internal Worker</code>’s Reputation and <code>External Worker</code>’s <code>CSPR</code> stake is returned.</li>
<li><code>External Worker</code>’s Reputation that was minted using <code>CSPR</code> stake is burned.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="returning-dos-fee"><a href="#returning-dos-fee">Returning DOS Fee</a></h2>
<p>The final step of the process is returning the <code>CSPR</code> <code>DOS Fee</code> to the <code>Job Poster</code>.</p>
<h2 id="grace-period"><a href="#grace-period">Grace Period</a></h2>
<p>However, if <code>External Worker</code> do not post a <code>Job Proof</code> in time, his <code>CSPR</code> stake is redistributed
between all <code>VA’s</code>.
In case of <code>Internal Worker</code>, his staked <code>Reputation</code> gets burned and it undergoes the
<code>Automated Reputation slashing</code> see <a href="../slashing_voter/index.html"><code>Slashing Voter</code></a>.
Then the process enters a <code>Grace period</code> (with the timeframe the same as the timeframe of the work for <code>Worker</code>).
During this period, anyone (<code>VA</code>, <code>External Worker</code>, even the original <code>Worker</code>) can submit the <code>Job Proof</code>,
becoming the new <code>Worker</code> and participating in the reward mechanism. Alongside the <code>Job Proof</code>,
a <code>Worker</code> needs to send a stake in form of <code>Reputation</code> (or <code>CSPR</code> for <code>External Worker</code>).
This stake will behave in the same manner as stake sent by the original <code>Worker</code>.
If nobody submits the <code>Job Proof</code> during the grace period, the whole process ends.
The <code>CSPR</code> paid by the <code>Job Poster</code> is returned along with the <code>DOS Fee</code>.
This is a special implementation of [positional parameters].</p>
