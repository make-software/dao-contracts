      | account          | CSPR balance | REP balance  | REP stake  | is_kyced | is_va |
      | BidEscrow        | 0            | 0            | 0          | false    | false |
      | MultisigWallet   | 0            | 0            | 0          | false    | false |
      | JobPoster        | 1000         | 0            | 0          | true     | false |
      | InternalWorker   | 0            | 1000         | 0          | true     | true  |
      | VA1              | 0            | 1000         | 0          | true     | true  |
      | VA2              | 0            | 1000         | 0          | true     | true  |
      | VA3              | 0            | 1000         | 0          | true     | true  |
    And following configuration
      | key                                    | value             |
      | DistributePaymentToNonVoters           | false             |
      | TimeBetweenInformalAndFormalVoting     | 0                 |
    When JobPoster posted a JobOffer with expected timeframe of 14 days, maximum budget of 1000 CSPR and 100 CSPR DOS Fee
    And InternalWorker posted the Bid with proposed timeframe of 7 days and 500 CSPR price and 100 REP stake
    And JobPoster picked the Bid of InternalWorker

  Scenario: Distributing payment only to voters
    When InternalWorker submits the JobProof
    And votes are
      | account          | vote | stake |
     #| InternalWorker   | Yes  | 100   | - automatically voted by the system
      | VA1              | Yes  | 500   |
      | VA2              | Yes  | 500   |
    And Informal voting ends
    Then balances are
      | account          | CSPR balance | REP balance  | REP stake  |
      | BidEscrow        | 600          | 0            | 0          |
      | MultisigWallet   | 0            | 0            | 0          |
      | JobPoster        | 400          | 0            | 0          |
      | InternalWorker   | 0            | 1000         | 100        |
      | VA1              | 0            | 1000         | 0          |
      | VA2              | 0            | 1000         | 0          |
    When votes are
      | account          | vote | stake |
     #| InternalWorker   | Yes  | 100   | - automatically voted by the system
      | VA1              | Yes  | 500   |
      | VA2              | No   | 500   |
