    Background:
      Given users
        | user    | is_va | REP balance |
        | Alice   | false | 0           |
        | VA1     | true  | 1000        |

    Scenario Outline: Informal voting quorum not reached, formal voting does not start
      When VA1 starts voting with the following config
