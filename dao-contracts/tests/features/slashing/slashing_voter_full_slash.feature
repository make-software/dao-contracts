  Scenario: VA1 gets removed from the DAO

    # VA1 crates a new voter.
    When VA1 creates test voting in KycVoter with 100 stake
    And voters vote in KycVoter informal voting with id 0
        | account | stake | vote | 
      # | VA1     | 100   | yes  | - automatically voted by the system
        | VA2     | 200   | yes  |

    # VA1 participates in another vote.
    When VA2 creates test voting in RepoVoter with 300 stake
    And voters vote in RepoVoter informal voting with id 1
        | account | stake | vote | 
        | VA1     | 200   | yes  |
      # | VA2     | 300   | yes  | - automatically voted by the system

    Then balances are
      | account          | CSPR balance | REP balance  | REP stake  |
      | VA1              | 10000        | 1000         | 300        |
      | VA2              | 0            | 2000         | 500        |

    # TODO: VA1 is worker in active job
    # TODO: VA1 is job poster in active job
    # TODO: VA1 votes in job acceptance voting.
