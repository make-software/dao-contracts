    When JobPoster posted a JobOffer with expected timeframe of 14 days, maximum budget of 1000 CSPR and 400 CSPR DOS Fee
    And InternalWorker posted the Bid for JobOffer 0 with proposed timeframe of 7 days and 500 CSPR price and 100 REP stake
    And 8 days passed
    And ExternalWorker posted the Bid for JobOffer 0 with proposed timeframe of 7 days and 500 CSPR price and 500 CSPR stake with onboarding
