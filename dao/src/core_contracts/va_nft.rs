//! Contains VA NFT Contract definition and related abstractions.
//!
//! # Definitions
//! * Voting Associate (or VA) - users of the system with Reputation and permissions to vote.
//! * External Worker - a Worker who completed the KYC and is not a Voting Associate.
//!
//! # Purpose
//! Ownership of a VA token indicates the address is a VA and is eligible to participate in Voting.
//! If an `External Worker` finishes a job successfully, and wants to become a VA, receives a VA token
//! as a reward. See [`Bid Escrow`].
//!
//! Each [`Address`] can own only one VA token.
//!
//! [`Bid Escrow`]: crate::bid_escrow::BidEscrowContractInterface.
