//! Contains Bid Escrow Contract definition and related abstractions.
//!
//! # Definitions
//! * Job Offer - A description of a Job posted by JobPoster
//! * Bid - on offer that can be accepted by the Job Poster
//! * JobPoster - user of the system that posts a Job Offer; it has to be KYC’d
//! * Worker - the user who does a job
//! * Internal Worker - a Worker who completed the KYC and was voted to be a VotingAssociate
//! * External Worker - a Worker who completed the KYC and is not a Voting Associate
//! * Voting Associate (or VA) - users of the system with Reputation and permissions to vote
//! * KYC - Know Your Customer, a process that validates that the user can be the user of the system
//! * Bid Escrow Voting - Mints reputation
//!
//! # Posting
//! The first step of the `Bid Escrow` process is `Posting` a [`Job Offer`](JobOffer).
//! It is done by `JobPoster` by sending a query to a `BidEscrow` contract containing:
//! * Expected timeframe for completing a `Job`
//! * Maximum budget for a `Job`
//! With the query, the `JobPoster` sends a `DOS fee` in `CSPR`. The minimum amount of a `DOS fee` is defined in
//! [`Variable Repository Contract`] under the key`PostJobDOSFee`.
//! This action creates a new object in the contract called `Job Offer` and starts the `Bidding process`.
//!
//! # Bidding
//! The `Bidding` process allows `Workers` to post [`Bids`](Bid) with the offer of completing a job.
//! It is divided into two main parts.
//!
//! ### Internal Auction
//! During this part of the Bidding process only the `VAs` can bid. As the `VAs` have `Reputation`, they are bidding using
//! [`Reputation`] as a stake. The `Bid` query to the contract consists of:
//! * Proposed timeframe for completing the `Job`.
//! * Proposed payment for the `Job`.
//! * The amount of `Reputation` the `Internal Worker` stakes on this `Job`.
//!
//! The Bid is then added to a list of available bids in the contract storage and is available for picking by the `Job Poster`.
//! The time of an `Internal Auction` is defined in a [`Governance Variable`] `InternalAuctionTime`.
//! The bidding process can already be completed here, if the `JobPoster` decides to chose one of the posted Bids before `Internal Auction` ends.
//! However, if no `Bid` is picked during this time, the process becomes a `Public Auction`.
//!
//! ### Public Auction
//! If no `Internal Worker` decides to post a `Bid` on a `Job Offer`, or the `Job Poster` did not pick any bid during `Internal Auction`,
//! the `External Workers` have a chance of submitting their bids during `Public Auction` time. As `External Workers` do not have any
//! `Reputation` to stake, they are staking `CSPR`.
//!
//! A query to the contract in case of `External Workers` consists of:
//! * Proposed timeframe for completing the `Job`.
//! * Proposed payment for the `Job`.
//! * Decision if the `Worker` wants to become a `Voting Associate` if the `Job` is completed.
//! * `CSPR` stake sent alongside the query
//! `Internal Workers` by default cannot to submit their bids during `Public Auction`, however this behavior is configurable using
//! `VACanBidOnPublicAuction` [`Governance Variable`].
//!
//! The time of a `Public Auction` is defined in a [`Governance Variable`] `PublicAuctionTime`.
//!
//! # Picking a Bid
//! During the `Auction` process the `Job Poster` can pick a `Bid`.
//! When no `Bid` is posted or selected by `Job Poster` during both auctions, the `Job` is cancelled,
//! `DOS Fee` is returned to the `Job Poster` and stakes sent by the `Bidders` are returned to them.
//!
//! # Submitting a Job Proof
//! Now the `Worker` has the time to complete the `Job` and submit its proof to the contract.
//! After the works have been completed, the `Worker` sends a query to the contract containing
//! the cryptographic hash of a document being a proof of `Work` done for a `Job Poster`.
//!
//! When no `Bid` is posted or selected by the `Job Poster` during both auctions, the `Job` is cancelled,
//! `DOS Fee` is returned to the `Job Poster` and stakes sent by the `Bidders` are returned to them.
//!
//! # Voting
//! The Voting process is managed by [`VotingEngine`].
//!
//! # Voting passed
//! Besides yielding a positive result, the `Voting` passed means that the `Reputation` staked by the losing side is
//! redistributed between the winning side, depending on the type of `Worker`.
//! ### External Worker who wanted to become VA
//! * The `External Worker` becomes VA.
//! * The `CSPR` that were sent by the `External Worker` as a stake is returned to the `External Worker`.
//! * Reputation of the voters who voted `yes` is returned to them.
//! * Reputation of the voters who voted `no` is redistributed between the voters who voted `yes` proportional to the amount of
//! reputation staked in the voting.
//! * Reputation minted for the `External Worker` and used in the voting process is burned.
//!
//! ### Internal Worker
//! * Reputation of the voters who voted `yes` is returned to them.
//! * Reputation of the voters who voted `no` is redistributed between the voters who voted `yes` proportional to the amount of
//! reputation staked in the voting.
//!
//! ### External Worker
//! * The `CSPR` that were sent by the `External Worker` as a stake is returned to the `External Worker`.
//! * Reputation minted for the `External Worker` and used in the voting process is burned.
//! * Reputation of the voters who voted `yes` is returned to them, except for the Reputation minted for the Worker using `CSPR` stake.
//! * Reputation of the voters who voted `no` is redistributed between the voters who voted `yes` proportional to the amount of
//! reputation staked in the voting (External Worker does not receive Reputation in this step).
//!
//! ### Payment CSPR Redistribution
//! Reputation used for the Voting and minted after a successful `Job` has been redistributed during the above process,
//! but there is `CSPR` to redistribute that was allocated to the `Job`. How much resources is redistributed and to whom
//! depends on the type of `Worker` and whether it wanted to become a `VA`.
//!
//! ### Payment pool
//! The `CSPR` to redistribute is calculated using a formula:
//! `payment pool = job price`
//!
//! ### External Worker who wants to become VA
//! As the External Worker now is the VA, it is considered to be an `Internal Worker` in this scenario.
//!
//! ### Internal Worker
//! Firstly the Governance Payment is calculated using a formula:
//!
//! `governance payment = payment pool * BidEscrowPaymentRatio` [Read more](crate::core_contracts::VariableRepositoryContract#available-keys).
//!
//! The `Governance Payment` is then transferred to a multisig wallet, which address is held in the [`Variable Repository Contract`]
//! called [`BidEscrowWalletAddress`](crate::core_contracts::VariableRepositoryContract#available-keys).
//! The rest of the payment is redistributed between all of the `VAs'`.
//!
//! `remaining amount = payment pool - governance payment`
//!
//! ### External Worker
//! If the `Job` was done by an `External Worker` who didn't want to become a `VA`, the first step is the same
//! as in the case of `Internal Worker` - Governance Payment is being made. However the rest is then divided between
//! the `External Worker` and the `VAs’`.
//!
//! Firstly to get the amount that VA’s receive we use a formula:
//!
//! `VA payment amount = remaining amount * DefaultPolicingRate` [Read more](crate::core_contracts::VariableRepositoryContract#available-keys)
//!
//! Then, the rest is transferred to the `External Worker`:
//!
//! `External Worker payment amount = payment pool- governance payment - VA payment amount`
//!
//! # Voting failed
//! Besides yielding a negative result, the Voting passed means that the Reputation staked by the losing side is
//! redistributed between the winning side, depending on the type of Worker.
//!
//! ### External Worker who wanted to become VA
//! * The External Worked DOES NOT become a VA.
//! * The `CSPR` that were sent by the `External Worker` as a stake is redistributed between the `VA`’s.
//! * The Reputation minted for the `External Worker` using `CSPR` stake is burned.
//! * Reputation of the voters who voted `no` is returned to them.
//! * Reputation of the voters who voted `yes` is redistributed between the voters who voted `no` proportional to the amount of
//! reputation staked in the voting.
//!
//! ### Internal Worker
//! * Reputation of the voters who voted `no` is returned to them.
//! * Reputation of the voters who voted `yes` is redistributed between the voters who voted `no` proportional to the amount of
//! reputation staked in the voting.
//!
//! ### External Worker
//! The `CSPR` that were sent by the `External Worker` as a stake is redistributed between the `VA`’s.
//! The Reputation minted for the `External Worker` using `CSPR` stake is burned.
//! Reputation of the voters who voted `no` is returned to them.
//! Reputation of the voters who voted `yes` is redistributed between the voters who voted `no` proportional to the amount of
//! reputation staked in the voting.
//!
//! ### CSPR
//! If the `Voting` fails, the `CSPR` sent to the contract as a payment for `Job` is returned to the `Job Poster`. If the work
//! has been attempted to do by an `External Worker` the `CSPR` that the `Worker` staked during the `Bid` process
//! is redistributed between all `VA`’s.
//!
//! # Quorum not reached
//! When the `Quorum` is not reached during the `Formal Voting`, following things happen:
//! * The process ends here.
//! * `VA’s` stakes are returned to them.
//! * `Job` Poster payment and `DOS fee is returned.
//! * `Internal Worker`’s Reputation and `External Worker`’s `CSPR` stake is returned.
//! * `External Worker`’s Reputation that was minted using `CSPR` stake is burned.
//!
//! # Returning DOS Fee
//! The final step of the process is returning the `CSPR` `DOS Fee` to the `Job Poster`.
//!
//! # Grace Period
//! However, if `External Worker` do not post a `Job Proof` in time, his `CSPR` stake is redistributed
//! between all `VA’s`.
//! In case of `Internal Worker`, his staked `Reputation` gets burned and it undergoes the
//! `Automated Reputation slashing` see [`Slashing Voter`].
//! Then the process enters a `Grace period` (with the timeframe the same as the timeframe of the work for `Worker`).
//! During this period, anyone (`VA`, `External Worker`, even the original `Worker`) can submit the `Job Proof`,
//! becoming the new `Worker` and participating in the reward mechanism. Alongside the `Job Proof`,
//! a `Worker` needs to send a stake in form of `Reputation` (or `CSPR` for `External Worker`).
//! This stake will behave in the same manner as stake sent by the original `Worker`.
//! If nobody submits the `Job Proof` during the grace period, the whole process ends.
//! The `CSPR` paid by the `Job Poster` is returned along with the `DOS Fee`.
//! This is a special implementation of [positional parameters].
