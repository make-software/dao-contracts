//! Contains Onboarding Request Contract definition and related abstractions.
//!
//! # Definitions
//! * Job Offer - A description of a Job posted by JobPoster
//! * Bid - on offer that can be accepted by the Job Poster
//! * JobPoster - user of the system that posts a Job Offer; it has to be KYC’d
//! * External Worker - a Worker who completed the KYC and is not a Voting Associate
//! * Voting Associate (or VA) - users of the system with Reputation and permissions to vote
//! * KYC - Know Your Customer, a process that validates that the user can be the user of the system
//! * Bid Escrow Voting - Mints reputation
//!
//! # Onboarding Request
//! One of the side effects of completing a `Job` by an `External Worker` is the possibility to become a `Voting Associate`.
//! It is also possible to become one without completing a `Job` using [`Bid Escrow Contract`].
//! To do this, an `External Worker` submits an `Onboarding Request` containing `Document Hash` of a document containing the reason
//! why the `Onboarding` should be done and a `CSPR` stake.
//!
//! The rest of the process is analogous to the regular `Job` [submission process] of an `External Worker`, except that instead of
//! redistribution of `Job Payment` between `VA`’s we redistribute the stake of the `External Worker`.
//! If the process fails, the `CSPR` stake of the `External Worker` is returned.
//!
//! # Voting
//! The Voting process is managed by [`VotingEngine`].
