//! Contains KYC NFT Contract definition and related abstractions.
//!
//! # Definitions
//! KYC - Know Your Customer, is a process that validates that the user can be the user of the system.
//!
//! # Purpose
//! Ownership of a KYC token indicates the address has been successfully verified and is eligible to participate in the system.
//! Minting token is usually done as a result of [`KYC Voting`].
//!
//! Each [`Address`] can own only one KYC token.
