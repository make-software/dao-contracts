</ul>
<h2 id="posting"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#posting">§</a>Posting</h2>
<p>The first step of the <code>Bid Escrow</code> process is <code>Posting</code> a <a href="../job_offer/struct.JobOffer.html" title="struct dao::bid_escrow::job_offer::JobOffer"><code>Job Offer</code></a>.
It is done by <code>JobPoster</code> by sending a query to a <code>BidEscrow</code> contract containing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Expected timeframe for completing a <code>Job</code></li>
<li>Maximum budget for a <code>Job</code>
With the query, the <code>JobPoster</code> sends a <code>DOS fee</code> in <code>CSPR</code>. The minimum amount of a <code>DOS fee</code> is defined in
<a href="../../core_contracts/struct.VariableRepositoryContract.html" title="struct dao::core_contracts::VariableRepositoryContract"><code>Variable Repository Contract</code></a> under the key<code>PostJobDOSFee</code>.
This action creates a new object in the contract called <code>Job Offer</code> and starts the <code>Bidding process</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="bidding"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#bidding">§</a>Bidding</h2>
<p>The <code>Bidding</code> process allows <code>Workers</code> to post <a href="../bid/struct.Bid.html" title="struct dao::bid_escrow::bid::Bid"><code>Bids</code></a> with the offer of completing a job.
It is divided into two main parts.</p>
<h4 id="internal-auction"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#internal-auction">§</a>Internal Auction</h4>
<p>During this part of the Bidding process only the <code>VAs</code> can bid. As the <code>VAs</code> have <code>Reputation</code>, they are bidding using
<a href="../../core_contracts/struct.ReputationContract.html" title="struct dao::core_contracts::ReputationContract"><code>Reputation</code></a> as a stake. The <code>Bid</code> query to the contract consists of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Proposed timeframe for completing the <code>Job</code>.</li>
<li>Proposed payment for the <code>Job</code>.</li>
<li>The amount of <code>Reputation</code> the <code>Internal Worker</code> stakes on this <code>Job</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Bid is then added to a list of available bids in the contract storage and is available for picking by the <code>Job Poster</code>.
The time of an <code>Internal Auction</code> is defined in a <a href="../../core_contracts/struct.VariableRepositoryContract.html#available-keys" title="struct dao::core_contracts::VariableRepositoryContract"><code>Governance Variable</code></a> <code>InternalAuctionTime</code>.
The bidding process can already be completed here, if the <code>JobPoster</code> decides to chose one of the posted Bids before <code>Internal Auction</code> ends.
However, if no <code>Bid</code> is picked during this time, the process becomes a <code>Public Auction</code>.</p>
<h4 id="public-auction"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#public-auction">§</a>Public Auction</h4>
<p>If no <code>Internal Worker</code> decides to post a <code>Bid</code> on a <code>Job Offer</code>, or the <code>Job Poster</code> did not pick any bid during <code>Internal Auction</code>,
the <code>External Workers</code> have a chance of submitting their bids during <code>Public Auction</code> time. As <code>External Workers</code> do not have any
<code>Reputation</code> to stake, they are staking <code>CSPR</code>.</p>
<p>A query to the contract in case of <code>External Workers</code> consists of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Proposed timeframe for completing the <code>Job</code>.</li>
<li>Proposed payment for the <code>Job</code>.</li>
<li>Decision if the <code>Worker</code> wants to become a <code>Voting Associate</code> if the <code>Job</code> is completed.</li>
<li><code>CSPR</code> stake sent alongside the query
<code>Internal Workers</code> by default cannot to submit their bids during <code>Public Auction</code>, however this behavior is configurable using
<code>VACanBidOnPublicAuction</code> <a href="../../core_contracts/struct.VariableRepositoryContract.html#available-keys" title="struct dao::core_contracts::VariableRepositoryContract"><code>Governance Variable</code></a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The time of a <code>Public Auction</code> is defined in a <a href="../../core_contracts/struct.VariableRepositoryContract.html#available-keys" title="struct dao::core_contracts::VariableRepositoryContract"><code>Governance Variable</code></a> <code>PublicAuctionTime</code>.</p>
<h2 id="picking-a-bid"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#picking-a-bid">§</a>Picking a Bid</h2>
<p>During the <code>Auction</code> process the <code>Job Poster</code> can pick a <code>Bid</code>.
When no <code>Bid</code> is posted or selected by <code>Job Poster</code> during both auctions, the <code>Job</code> is cancelled,
<code>DOS Fee</code> is returned to the <code>Job Poster</code> and stakes sent by the <code>Bidders</code> are returned to them.</p>
<h2 id="submitting-a-job-proof"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#submitting-a-job-proof">§</a>Submitting a Job Proof</h2>
<p>Now the <code>Worker</code> has the time to complete the <code>Job</code> and submit its proof to the contract.
After the works have been completed, the <code>Worker</code> sends a query to the contract containing
the cryptographic hash of a document being a proof of <code>Work</code> done for a <code>Job Poster</code>.</p>
<p>When no <code>Bid</code> is posted or selected by the <code>Job Poster</code> during both auctions, the <code>Job</code> is cancelled,
<code>DOS Fee</code> is returned to the <code>Job Poster</code> and stakes sent by the <code>Bidders</code> are returned to them.</p>
<h2 id="voting"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#voting">§</a>Voting</h2>
<p>The Voting process is managed by <a href="../../voting/voting_engine/struct.VotingEngine.html" title="struct dao::voting::voting_engine::VotingEngine"><code>VotingEngine</code></a>.</p>
<h2 id="voting-passed"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#voting-passed">§</a>Voting passed</h2>
<p>Besides yielding a positive result, the <code>Voting</code> passed means that the <code>Reputation</code> staked by the losing side is
redistributed between the winning side, depending on the type of <code>Worker</code>.</p>
<h4 id="external-worker-who-wanted-to-become-va"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#external-worker-who-wanted-to-become-va">§</a>External Worker who wanted to become VA</h4>
<ul>
<li>The <code>External Worker</code> becomes VA.</li>
<li>The <code>CSPR</code> that were sent by the <code>External Worker</code> as a stake is returned to the <code>External Worker</code>.</li>
<li>Reputation of the voters who voted <code>yes</code> is returned to them.</li>
<li>Reputation of the voters who voted <code>no</code> is redistributed between the voters who voted <code>yes</code> proportional to the amount of

<li>Reputation minted for the <code>External Worker</code> and used in the voting process is burned.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="internal-worker"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#internal-worker">§</a>Internal Worker</h4>
<ul>
<li>Reputation of the voters who voted <code>yes</code> is returned to them.</li>
<li>Reputation of the voters who voted <code>no</code> is redistributed between the voters who voted <code>yes</code> proportional to the amount of
reputation staked in the voting.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="external-worker"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#external-worker">§</a>External Worker</h4>
<ul>
<li>The <code>CSPR</code> that were sent by the <code>External Worker</code> as a stake is returned to the <code>External Worker</code>.</li>
<li>Reputation minted for the <code>External Worker</code> and used in the voting process is burned.</li>
<li>Reputation of the voters who voted <code>yes</code> is returned to them, except for the Reputation minted for the Worker using <code>CSPR</code> stake.</li>
<li>Reputation of the voters who voted <code>no</code> is redistributed between the voters who voted <code>yes</code> proportional to the amount of
reputation staked in the voting (External Worker does not receive Reputation in this step).</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="payment-cspr-redistribution"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#payment-cspr-redistribution">§</a>Payment CSPR Redistribution</h4>
<p>Reputation used for the Voting and minted after a successful <code>Job</code> has been redistributed during the above process,
but there is <code>CSPR</code> to redistribute that was allocated to the <code>Job</code>. How much resources is redistributed and to whom
depends on the type of <code>Worker</code> and whether it wanted to become a <code>VA</code>.</p>
<h4 id="payment-pool"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#payment-pool">§</a>Payment pool</h4>
<p>The <code>CSPR</code> to redistribute is calculated using a formula:
<code>payment pool = job price</code></p>
<h4 id="external-worker-who-wants-to-become-va"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#external-worker-who-wants-to-become-va">§</a>External Worker who wants to become VA</h4>
<p>As the External Worker now is the VA, it is considered to be an <code>Internal Worker</code> in this scenario.</p>
<h4 id="internal-worker-1"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#internal-worker-1">§</a>Internal Worker</h4>
<p>Firstly the Governance Payment is calculated using a formula:</p>
<p><code>governance payment = payment pool * BidEscrowPaymentRatio</code> <a href="../../core_contracts/struct.VariableRepositoryContract.html#available-keys" title="struct dao::core_contracts::VariableRepositoryContract">Read more</a>.</p>
<p>The <code>Governance Payment</code> is then transferred to a multisig wallet, which address is held in the <a href="../../core_contracts/struct.VariableRepositoryContract.html" title="struct dao::core_contracts::VariableRepositoryContract"><code>Variable Repository Contract</code></a>
called <a href="../../core_contracts/struct.VariableRepositoryContract.html#available-keys" title="struct dao::core_contracts::VariableRepositoryContract"><code>BidEscrowWalletAddress</code></a>.
The rest of the payment is redistributed between all of the <code>VAs'</code>.</p>
<p><code>remaining amount = payment pool - governance payment</code></p>
<h4 id="external-worker-1"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#external-worker-1">§</a>External Worker</h4>
<p>If the <code>Job</code> was done by an <code>External Worker</code> who didn’t want to become a <code>VA</code>, the first step is the same
as in the case of <code>Internal Worker</code> - Governance Payment is being made. However the rest is then divided between
the <code>External Worker</code> and the <code>VAs’</code>.</p>
<p>Firstly to get the amount that VA’s receive we use a formula:</p>
<p><code>VA payment amount = remaining amount * DefaultPolicingRate</code> <a href="../../core_contracts/struct.VariableRepositoryContract.html#available-keys" title="struct dao::core_contracts::VariableRepositoryContract">Read more</a></p>
<p>Then, the rest is transferred to the <code>External Worker</code>:</p>
<p><code>External Worker payment amount = payment pool- governance payment - VA payment amount</code></p>
<h2 id="voting-failed"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#voting-failed">§</a>Voting failed</h2>
<p>Besides yielding a negative result, the Voting passed means that the Reputation staked by the losing side is
redistributed between the winning side, depending on the type of Worker.</p>
<h4 id="external-worker-who-wanted-to-become-va-1"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#external-worker-who-wanted-to-become-va-1">§</a>External Worker who wanted to become VA</h4>
<ul>
<li>The External Worked DOES NOT become a VA.</li>
<li>The <code>CSPR</code> that were sent by the <code>External Worker</code> as a stake is redistributed between the <code>VA</code>’s.</li>
<li>The Reputation minted for the <code>External Worker</code> using <code>CSPR</code> stake is burned.</li>
<li>Reputation of the voters who voted <code>no</code> is returned to them.</li>
<li>Reputation of the voters who voted <code>yes</code> is redistributed between the voters who voted <code>no</code> proportional to the amount of

</ul>
<h4 id="internal-worker-2"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#internal-worker-2">§</a>Internal Worker</h4>
<ul>
<li>Reputation of the voters who voted <code>no</code> is returned to them.</li>
<li>Reputation of the voters who voted <code>yes</code> is redistributed between the voters who voted <code>no</code> proportional to the amount of
reputation staked in the voting.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="external-worker-2"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#external-worker-2">§</a>External Worker</h4>
<p>The <code>CSPR</code> that were sent by the <code>External Worker</code> as a stake is redistributed between the <code>VA</code>’s.
The Reputation minted for the <code>External Worker</code> using <code>CSPR</code> stake is burned.
Reputation of the voters who voted <code>no</code> is returned to them.
Reputation of the voters who voted <code>yes</code> is redistributed between the voters who voted <code>no</code> proportional to the amount of
reputation staked in the voting.</p>
<h4 id="cspr"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#cspr">§</a>CSPR</h4>
<p>If the <code>Voting</code> fails, the <code>CSPR</code> sent to the contract as a payment for <code>Job</code> is returned to the <code>Job Poster</code>. If the work
has been attempted to do by an <code>External Worker</code> the <code>CSPR</code> that the <code>Worker</code> staked during the <code>Bid</code> process
is redistributed between all <code>VA</code>’s.</p>
<h2 id="quorum-not-reached"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#quorum-not-reached">§</a>Quorum not reached</h2>
<p>When the <code>Quorum</code> is not reached during the <code>Formal Voting</code>, following things happen:</p>
<ul>
<li>The process ends here.</li>
<li><code>VA’s</code> stakes are returned to them.</li>
<li><code>Job</code> Poster payment and `DOS fee is returned.</li>
<li><code>Internal Worker</code>’s Reputation and <code>External Worker</code>’s <code>CSPR</code> stake is returned.</li>
<li><code>External Worker</code>’s Reputation that was minted using <code>CSPR</code> stake is burned.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="returning-dos-fee"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#returning-dos-fee">§</a>Returning DOS Fee</h2>
<p>The final step of the process is returning the <code>CSPR</code> <code>DOS Fee</code> to the <code>Job Poster</code>.</p>
<h2 id="grace-period"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#grace-period">§</a>Grace Period</h2>
<p>However, if <code>External Worker</code> do not post a <code>Job Proof</code> in time, his <code>CSPR</code> stake is redistributed
between all <code>VA’s</code>.
In case of <code>Internal Worker</code>, his staked <code>Reputation</code> gets burned and it undergoes the
<code>Automated Reputation slashing</code> see <a href="../../voting_contracts/struct.SlashingVoterContract.html" title="struct dao::voting_contracts::SlashingVoterContract"><code>Slashing Voter</code></a>.
Then the process enters a <code>Grace period</code> (with the timeframe the same as the timeframe of the work for <code>Worker</code>).
During this period, anyone (<code>VA</code>, <code>External Worker</code>, even the original <code>Worker</code>) can submit the <code>Job Proof</code>,
becoming the new <code>Worker</code> and participating in the reward mechanism. Alongside the <code>Job Proof</code>,
a <code>Worker</code> needs to send a stake in form of <code>Reputation</code> (or <code>CSPR</code> for <code>External Worker</code>).
This stake will behave in the same manner as stake sent by the original <code>Worker</code>.
If nobody submits the <code>Job Proof</code> during the grace period, the whole process ends.
The <code>CSPR</code> paid by the <code>Job Poster</code> is returned along with the <code>DOS Fee</code>.
This is a special implementation of [positional parameters].</p>
