      | DefaultReputationSlash                 | 0     |

    When JobPoster posted a JobOffer with expected timeframe of 14 days, maximum budget of 1000 CSPR and 400 CSPR DOS Fee
    And InternalWorker posted the Bid for JobOffer 0 with proposed timeframe of 7 days and 500 CSPR price and 100 REP stake
    And JobPoster picked the Bid of InternalWorker

  Scenario: Someone else sends a JobProof
    Then VA1 cannot submit the JobProof of Job 0
